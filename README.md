# ANN-Experiments
My experiments with artificial neural nets, along with some reports

# Context
Inspiration for these scripts comes mostly from lectures and exercise sessions 
of the Artificial Neural Networks class at KU Leuven (Spring 2016). The 
programming environment used to illustrate the concepts was matlab. I used
Matlab R2015b, with the Neural Network Toolbox.

# Perceptron
Collection of homemade functions displaying characteristics of perceptrons.
